The second project of our group is based on React.js and our goal is to make a responsive weather application, named Suni.

The user will be able to get, for the locations he chooses, key informations about the weather : forecast, temperatures, wind speed, humidity, feels like temperature, sunrise and sunset hours.

A feature allows the user to get a forecast up to 3 days every 6 hours.
We also integrated a subscription to a newsletter that would send up daily or weekly forecasts to the user.
